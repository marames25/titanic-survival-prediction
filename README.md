# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a machine learning solution for the classic **Titanic Kaggle competition**.  
The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, class, and more.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Maram_Titanic.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with the full workflow: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- Data: Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) 

## ⚙️ Steps in the Notebook
1. **Data Exploration** – Understand the dataset and handle missing values.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Encoding categorical variables, scaling numeric features.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Creating additional features for better prediction.  
4. **Model Training** – Tried multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Compared performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall.  
6. **Prediction** – Generated predictions for the test dataset.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
